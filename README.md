## About The Project

**Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)** is a comprehensive, console-based application designed for academic administration. It provides a full suite of tools for managing student records, course catalogs, enrollments, and grades through a simple command-line interface (CLI).

This project showcases the power of core Java principles and modern APIs, including:
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
* **NIO.2** for efficient file I/O
* The **Streams API** for powerful data manipulation
* The **Date/Time API**
* Key design patterns like **Singleton** and **Builder**

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21 or newer.**

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VISHESHJAIN2006/VITyarthi-Java-Project
    ```

2.  **Import into Eclipse IDE:**
    * Navigate to `File` > `Import` > `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace`.
    * Select the cloned repository directory.

3.  **Compile the Project:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/edu/ccrm/cli/Main.java
    ```

4.  **Execute the Application:**
    * Run the following command. The `-ea` flag is important as it **enables assertions** used for internal validation.
    ```bash
    java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.Main
    ```

> **Note:** Sample data files are available in `test-data/students.csv` and `test-data/courses.csv` to get you started.

## üß† Core Concepts Implemented

This project serves as a practical demonstration of several fundamental Java and software engineering concepts.

### Java Platform Editions: ME, SE, and EE

| Platform               | Description                                                        | Use Case                               | Relevance to CCRM                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Java ME** (Micro)    | A lightweight version for resource-constrained devices.            | Older mobile phones, IoT devices.      | Not used, as it lacks features for a desktop application. |
| **Java SE** (Standard) | The core Java platform for general-purpose applications.           | Desktop software, command-line tools.  | **This is the primary platform used for CCRM.** |
| **Java EE** (Enterprise) | Extends Java SE with APIs for large-scale enterprise servers.      | Web applications, web services.        | Not used, as CCRM is a standalone application.           |

<br/>

### JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM

* **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: The complete toolkit for Java developers. It includes the JRE, compiler (`javac`), debugger, and other tools. **You need this to compile and run CCRM.**
* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: The environment required to *run* Java applications. It contains the JVM and core libraries but lacks development tools.
* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: An abstract machine that runs compiled Java bytecode, enabling the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

### Syllabus Topic Mapping

This table highlights where key OOP and Java concepts are implemented within the project's source code.

| Topic              | Implementation Location                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation      | `edu.ccrm.domain/Person` (private fields) |
| Inheritance        | `edu.ccrm.domain/Student` (extends Person) |
| Abstraction        | `edu.ccrm.domain/Person` (abstract class) |
| Polymorphism       | `edu.ccrm.service/TranscriptService`   |
| Streams API        | `edu.ccrm.service/CourseService`       |
| NIO.2 API          | `edu.ccrm.io/ImportExportService`      |
| Design Patterns    | `edu.ccrm.config/AppConfig` (Singleton) |
| Exception Handling | `edu.ccrm.service/EnrollmentService`   |
